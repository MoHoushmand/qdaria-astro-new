**Og her er selve intervjuet med spørsmål og svar (Gjerne fordel det over nettsiden der det passer seg. Spm 1 handler mest om meg så kansdkje minst relevant men de andre er greie å få med seg i "Products"):** 

# **1. Could you share what inspired your leap into the quantum world and ultimately founding QDaria?**

## **Answer1 :**

Absolutely, and it's quite a bumpy journey! My path has been anything but conventional. I started out in Art & Design, which gave me a deep appreciation for creativity and an eye for intricate details. That creative foundation eventually somehow led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering to stimulate both hemispheres of my brain, where I became fascinated by the structural complexities of the physical world.

But it was during my Master's studies in Applied Mathematics and Solid Mechanics that I truly found my calling. I became utterly captivated—some might say obsessed—with fluid mechanics, especially the mysterious nature of turbulent flow. The way turbulence behaves in cerebral arteries with aneurysms intrigued me beyond measure. I wanted to simulate and visualize the vector-tensor fields in these aneurysms as blood flow velocities increased, to investigate what might happen before events like strokes.

Naively, I asked my supervisors if I could incorporate quantum mechanics into my master's thesis. At the smallest scales—the Kolmogorov length scale where turbulence dissipates—the behavior of particles becomes anything but classical. Deterministic models break down, and quantum mechanics, with all its inherent uncertainties, takes over. While incorporating quantum mechanics into my thesis was too ambitious at the time, this ignited a profound interest in the quantum realm.

Determined to position myself at the forefront of this field, I dove headfirst into courses not just in Financial Management and Marketing Management, but also in **Quantum Computing**, Quantum Algorithms for Cybersecurity, Chemistry and Optimization, Quantum Machine Learning, and Quantum Hardware Engineering. I wanted to bridge the gap between deep technical expertise and practical business applications.

Around 2018, I was approached by a startup to lead an AI project reminiscent of the movie "Her" (which I hadn't seen at the time). They even gave me free rein to assemble my own team abroad. However, the NDA they presented was too restrictive, and I couldn't, in good conscience, sign it without compromising prior commitments to my own team.

So, I made the tough decision to turn it down and instead founded what would become QDaria Our aim was to establish Quantum-Enhanced Synthetic Biology, a Quantum AI Lab, and a Quantum-Enhanced FinTech Lab focused on high-frequency trading. We became heavily involved in cybersecurity with our product Zipminator, in fintech with qm9, and in education with QDiana.

It's been a winding road, full of ups and downs. I even reached out to Professor Peter Wittek—a pioneer who introduced me to quantum machine learning—hoping he might join us. Tragically, he went missing in an avalanche in the Himalayas in 2019. Then the pandemic hit, and many plans were put on hold.

Despite the setbacks, I shared my work online, hoping it might help others. And then since no one else did anything about this quantum thing, out of the blue, I got a call: this was my chance to establish the first commercially available quantum computer in Norway. It's been an incredible journey, and I couldn't be more excited about what the future holds.


# 2. What unique advantages does your approach (Topological Quantum Computing and the use of Fibonacci Anyons) offer compared to other quantum computing methods?

**## Answer 2.:**


Great question! Our approach at QDaria leverages topological quantum computing using Fibonacci anyons, and it offers some truly unique advantages.

Most quantum computers today rely on qubits that are incredibly sensitive to their environment. Even the slightest disturbance—what we call decoherence—can cause errors. This makes them fragile and requires complex error correction methods.

Topological quantum computing, on the other hand, is inherently more robust. It uses the properties of space itself to protect quantum information. Fibonacci anyons are exotic quasiparticles that exist in two-dimensional systems. By braiding these anyons, we can perform computations that are naturally protected from local noise and decoherence.

It's like storing information in the way these particles wind around each other—a bit like tying knots that are hard to untie by accident. This reduces the need for error correction and makes the system more stable.

Our approach not only enhances the stability and reliability of quantum operations but also simplifies scalability. We're leveraging these properties in our products, like Zipminator, which uses advanced quantum algorithms for cybersecurity, ensuring unparalleled data security.

**# 3. Your mission to position Norway at the forefront of the Quantum AI revolution is ambitious. Can you tell us about the industries you’re targeting and how your solutions aim to transform them?**

**## 4. You’ve highlighted collaboration as a cornerstone of QDaria’s strategy. How are partnerships with organizations like Rigetti Computing and academic institutions shaping your development process?**

**## Answer 4.:**

Collaboration is indeed at the heart of what we do. Our partnerships have been instrumental in shaping our journey and accelerating our progress.

Back in 2017, I was fortunate to be contacted by Rick Avila from Rigetti Computing. They were doing groundbreaking work in quantum computing, and while I couldn't pursue opportunities with them at the time due to personal circumstances, it was the start of a valuable connection.

In the spring of 2024, we reconnected, and Rigetti invited us to the IQT Nordics conference in Espoo, Helsinki. Shortly after accepting the invitation, we received an exclusive tour of the Bluefors factory, which specializes in cryogenic dilution refrigerators essential for quantum computing.

At the conference, I met Mike Piech, the Vice President of Rigetti. He's an incredible person—brilliant and wonderfully supportive. He's shown tremendous faith in us, providing support and assistance whenever we've needed it. The Bluefors team, along with the entire IQT family, made the experience unforgettable. It fostered a warm, inclusive atmosphere that encouraged collaboration over competition.

I have to mention Knud Sørensen, the CEO of One Type Systems—a true genius and an even kinder soul. His insights have been invaluable.

Upon returning home, we were buzzing with excitement. Not only were we poised to launch the first ever commercially available quantum computer in Norway, but we were also approached about potentially hosting IQT 2026 in Oslo. Soon after, I was invited  to speak at the prestigious IQT New York conference in late October 2024, and IQT tops asked if we wanted to arrange IQT 2026 in Oslo which will be an historic event.

Prior to New York, I was invited by a wonderful individual named Spandana from Lloyds Bank in England  to Davos Innovation Week 2025 as a keynote speaker, where I'll be speaking, pitching, and moderating discussions.

Perhaps most humbling of all, a committee comprising presidents of some of the largest banks in Switzerland and England, investment funds, and members of the World Economic Forum informed us that we've been nominated among the top 25 most promising startups globally—independent of field and technology—and top 5 in Europe.

Our collaborations with academic institutions will be vital as we are providing them with experimental quantum mechanics kits in addition to all other resources our quantum platform has to offer. By engaging with universities, we're able to tap into cutting-edge research and foster talent development. These partnerships ensure we're at the forefront of scientific advancements and can integrate the latest discoveries into our technologies.

By working closely with both industry leaders and academic pioneers, we're not just building high-end technology—we're building a community dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what's possible in quantum computing.

**# Question 5.: Your educational platform, QDiana, aims to revolutionize STEM learning and empower future quantum leaders. What role do you see education playing in accelerating the adoption of quantum technologies?**

**## Answer 5:**

Education is absolutely critical in accelerating the adoption of quantum technologies, and with QDiana, we're aiming to revolutionize how people learn and engage with STEM fields, particularly quantum computing. We believe that by transforming education into an immersive and fulfilling experience, we can empower the next generation of quantum leaders.

One of our core initiatives with QDiana is to educate and certify professionals in the industry through comprehensive, high-end, and **industry-specific tailored professional certifications and specializations. These programs are designed to meet the highest standards and are acknowledged as such within the industry. By providing rigorous yet accessible certifications, we're helping to bridge the skills gap and ensure that organizations have access to top-tier talent proficient in quantum technologies.

To attract and engage learners, we're incorporating **colorful and engaging animations, visualizations using scientific art (sciart), and gamification into our educational content. By leveraging these creative techniques, we make complex quantum concepts more approachable and enjoyable to learn. The goal is to stimulate curiosity and maintain engagement, making the learning process as exciting as the subject matter itself.

Crucially, our educational programs are designed to facilitate a sense of accomplishment and mastery among students. We're inspired by the work of Hungarian psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, who introduced the concept of "Flow" in the 1980s. Flow is that optimal state where a person is fully immersed and involved in the activity at hand, leading to higher levels of enjoyment and intrinsic motivation. Csikszentmihalyi's research shows that when learners are challenged just enough—not too much to cause frustration and not too little to induce boredom—they achieve this flow state. We strive to create learning experiences that hit this sweet spot, keeping learners deeply engaged and motivated.

Additionally, we draw inspiration from Erich Fromm's book "The Art of Loving," which can be distilled into the importance of focus and concentration. Mastery in any discipline—whether it's quantum computing, art, or athletics—requires dedicated focus and consistent effort over time. By encouraging learners to cultivate these qualities, we're helping them not just to absorb information but to truly internalize and apply their knowledge.

In essence, education through QDiana is not merely about transferring information; it's about igniting passion, fostering deep understanding, and instilling confidence. We believe that when students feel a sense of mastery and accomplishment, they're more likely to continue exploring, innovating, and contributing to the field.

By providing high-quality, engaging, and tailored educational experiences, we're accelerating the development and adoption of quantum technologies. Education empowers individuals, and empowered individuals drive innovation. Through QDiana, we're nurturing the talents and minds that will shape the future of quantum computing and its applications across various industries.
