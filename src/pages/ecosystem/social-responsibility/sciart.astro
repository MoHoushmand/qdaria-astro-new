          Our SciArt project represents a unique intersection of science, art, and social responsibility. A significant portion of the art sold through this initiative is donated to various humanitarian projects worldwide that we actively support.

            <p class="text-base-300">
              Combating child trafficking and exploitation in countries like Nepal, Bali, and India. We focus particularly on rescuing young girls, some as young as 5-8 years old, who are held captive in inhumane conditions. These children often face tragic circumstances, with many not surviving past their twenties due to malnutrition and abuse. The current cost to rescue each child ranges between $4,000-5,000.

          QDaria is deeply committed to being more than just a passive donor. We are developing an active program to provide comprehensive support including:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-4 space-y-2">
          <li>Safe shelter and accommodation</li>
          <li>Nutritious food and healthcare</li>
          <li>Quality education and skill development</li>
          <li>Psychological support and rehabilitation</li>
          <li>Long-term care and monitoring</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg mt-6">
          Our goal is to give these children the life they deserve and support them through the healing process. Every piece of art sold through SciArt contributes directly to these vital causes.
