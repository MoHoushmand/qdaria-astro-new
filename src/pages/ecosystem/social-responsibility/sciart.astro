We focus particularly on rescuing young girls, some as young as 5-8 years old, who are held captive in inhumane conditions. These children often face tragic circumstances, with many not surviving past their twenties due to malnutrition and abuse. The current cost to rescue each child ranges between $4,000-5,000.
