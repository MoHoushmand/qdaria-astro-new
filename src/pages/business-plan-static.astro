      <p>
        QDaria is an early-stage startup at the intersection of quantum computing and artificial intelligence. 
        We are developing agentic AI systems and quantum software solutions while uniquely offering rentals 
        of experimental quantum computing kits to democratize access to cutting-edge hardware. This combined 
        focus positions QDaria to capitalize on the rapidly growing quantum computing market and the surge 
        of interest in AI providing an integrated solution stack that bridges current gaps in the industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        The global quantum computing industry is on the cusp of explosive growth projected to create nearly 
        <strong>$1 trillion in economic value by 2035</strong>. Today the market remains nascent (estimated 
        at only ~$1–2 billion in 2024) but it is expected to expand to <strong>$5–7 billion by 2029</strong> 
        as early commercial applications emerge. This immense growth trajectory coupled with over $30 billion 
        in government funding commitments to quantum R&D and record <strong>private investments (>$1.5 billion 
        in 2024 alone)</strong> highlights the <strong>unprecedented opportunity</strong> for new entrants. 
        QDaria's agile startup approach and unique blend of AI and quantum offerings enable us to move quickly 
        in this space.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our strategy is to develop multiple complementary products under the QDaria umbrella — including 
        quantum-enhanced software like <strong>Zipminator</strong> and <strong>Qm9</strong> and intelligent 
        agents like <strong>QDiana</strong> and <strong>QMikeAI</strong> — and eventually expand QDaria into 
        a holding company. Each major product line is envisioned as a future subsidiary positioned for an IPO 
        by 2030. This business plan details our market analysis product roadmap competitive positioning financial 
        projections and a step-by-step expansion timeline culminating in <strong>multiple IPO events by 2028–2030</strong>. 
        We also outline key milestones and risk factors with strategies to mitigate them ensuring a clear path 
        toward sustainable growth and value creation for stakeholders.

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Competitive Landscape</h2>
      <p>
        The current quantum computing landscape is a mix of well-funded tech giants specialized quantum hardware 
        startups and a handful of software-focused ventures. <strong>Competition</strong> can be grouped into a 
        few categories:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Tech Giants (IBM Google Microsoft Intel)</strong>: These companies have major quantum research 
          programs. IBM for instance offers cloud access to quantum processors (with 433-qubit machines already 
          online) and plans a 1000+ qubit system in the next year. Google achieved a milestone in quantum supremacy 
          in 2019 and continues R&D on superconducting qubit systems. Microsoft and Intel are investing in alternative 
          technologies (topological qubits and spin qubits respectively). These players have virtually unlimited R&D 
          budgets and integrate quantum research into broader tech stacks (e.g. Microsoft's Azure Quantum service). 
          However their focus is largely on hardware breakthroughs and platform services; none offer the kind of 
          <strong>agentic AI integration</strong> or hands-on kit rental service that QDaria is pursuing. We view 
          the tech giants more as enablers (providing hardware advances we can leverage) than direct competitors in 
          our niche.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Quantum Hardware Startups (IonQ Rigetti D-Wave PsiQuantum etc.)</strong>: Several pure-play quantum 
          companies have emerged some of which have gone public. <strong>IonQ</strong> (trapped-ion quantum computers) 
          and <strong>Rigetti</strong> (superconducting qubits) both listed via SPAC deals in 2021 and <strong>D-Wave 
          Systems</strong> (quantum annealing systems) in 2022. These firms have raised substantial funding (IonQ ~$84M 
          pre-IPO Rigetti ~$198M D-Wave <strong>>$300M</strong>). <strong>PsiQuantum</strong> still private has raised 
          over $600M to develop photonic quantum computers. These startups aim to deliver hardware power and often provide 
          cloud access to their machines. By contrast QDaria is <strong>hardware-agnostic</strong> – we do not build our 
          own quantum chips. Instead we partner with or rent existing quantum hardware (providing <em>physical access</em> 
          via our kit rentals) and focus on software and AI layers on top. This means our capital requirements are lower 
          but it also means we depend on the hardware ecosystem's progress (a manageable risk given the broad industry 
          investment). We differentiate by <strong>offering clients direct experimental access</strong> to small-scale 
          quantum devices and by developing software that works across multiple quantum platforms rather than betting on 
          one hardware approach.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Products and Services</h2>
      <p>
        QDaria's business model spans <strong>software AI and hardware access</strong>. Our key products and services include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Quantum Experimental Kits Rental:</strong> We rent out small-scale quantum computing devices to researchers 
          educators and enterprise R&D teams. These <em>"quantum kits"</em> allow hands-on experimentation with real qubits 
          in a controlled environment.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Zipminator (Quantum-Accelerated Software):</strong> Zipminator is QDaria's proprietary quantum software 
          solution aimed at <strong>data compression and optimization</strong>. It leverages quantum algorithms to achieve 
          compression ratios or optimization results beyond the capabilities of classical methods.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Qm9 (Quantum Software Platform):</strong> Qm9 is a codename for QDaria's broader <strong>quantum software 
          platform</strong>. This platform will include tools and libraries for developers to write and optimize quantum 
          algorithms possibly across different hardware.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>QDiana (Agentic AI System):</strong> QDiana is an <strong>agentic AI</strong> being developed by QDaria – 
          essentially an AI agent persona designed to assist businesses in leveraging quantum computing. QDiana acts as an 
          <em>"AI consultant"</em> that can understand a user's problem (in natural language or high-level terms) map it to 
          quantum algorithms or computations (if applicable) run those on the available quantum backends and then interpret 
          the results for the user.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>QMikeAI (Agentic AI System):</strong> QMikeAI is another AI agent under development intended as a 
          complementary persona to QDiana. Where QDiana might focus on enterprise decision support <strong>QMikeAI</strong> 
          could be tailored for <strong>developers and researchers</strong> working with quantum technology.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Strategic Roadmap and IPO Timeline</h2>
      <p>
        To achieve our ambitious vision QDaria will follow a phased expansion roadmap evolving from a single startup into 
        a multi-subsidiary <strong>holding company (QDaria Holdings)</strong> by the end of this decade.

      </div>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Key phases and milestones in our plan include:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>2025:</strong> <em>Foundation and Seed Stage.</em> QDaria is founded (Q1 2025) by a team of quantum 
          computing PhDs and AI experts. Core R&D begins on the Qm9 platform and AI agents. We secure initial <strong>seed 
          funding (e.g. angel/accelerator round of ~$1M)</strong> to develop prototypes. By Q4 2025 we launch a <strong>pilot 
          quantum kit rental program</strong> with two 2-qubit kits and one 3-qubit kit serving our first pilot customers 
          (one university and one corporate R&D lab). Early revenue from these pilot rentals is modest but provides valuable 
          user feedback.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2026:</strong> <em>Product Development and Market Validation.</em> With pilot feedback we iterate on our 
          offerings. QDaria aims to raise a <strong>Series A round (~$5–10M)</strong> in mid-2026 to accelerate development. 
          The funding will be used to: hire additional quantum software engineers and AI scientists expand our inventory of 
          rental kits and bring <strong>Zipminator</strong> to a beta release. By late 2026 we plan to have <strong>QMikeAI 
          integrated</strong> into the Qm9 platform as an alpha version (assisting internal developers and select early adopters). 
          We also aim to sign a few <strong>strategic partnerships</strong> – for example with a quantum hardware provider for 
          discounted access or with a consulting firm to refer clients to QDaria for quantum solutions. Key milestone: 
          <em>Zipminator v1.0</em> (beta) ready by end of 2026 demonstrating quantum advantage on a test dataset (even if on 
          a small scale).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2027:</strong> <em>Scaling Up and Organizational Structuring.</em> By 2027 we expect initial revenues from 
          kit rentals and possibly pilot software projects but we will likely remain in investment mode. A <strong>Series B 
          funding (~$20M)</strong> is targeted in 2027 to scale the business.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2028:</strong> <em>First IPO and Continued Growth.</em> We anticipate that by 2028 at least one of our 
          subsidiaries will be ready to go public. The leading candidate is <strong>Zipminator Inc.</strong> as the compression 
          solution could have the broadest immediate market and a clear business model appealing to public market investors. 
          We plan for <strong>Zipminator's IPO in 2028</strong> (likely in the second half depending on market conditions).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2029:</strong> <em>Multiple IPOs and Expansion.</em> By 2029 the quantum industry is expected to be in a 
          robust growth phase and QDaria's various businesses should be hitting their stride. We plan for <strong>two more 
          IPOs in 2029</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2030:</strong> <em>Final Planned IPO and Holding Company Maturation.</em> The year 2030 would see the IPO 
          of <strong>QMikeAI Inc.</strong> completing our plan for all four major units to become public entities.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Financial Projections</h2>
      <p>
        Our financial projections for QDaria (2025-2030) reflect the typical early-stage tech startup trajectory with initial 
        years focused on R&D and product development followed by accelerating revenue growth and eventual profitability.
