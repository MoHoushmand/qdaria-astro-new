## 5. Zipminator: Quantum Cryptography as a Service (QCaaS)

### 5.1 Executive Summary

Zipminator represents QDaria's flagship entry into the rapidly growing quantum-safe cybersecurity market. As the world's first commercially available Quantum Cryptography as a Service (QCaaS) platform, Zipminator combines NIST-approved post-quantum cryptography with real quantum entropy generation from IBM's 127-qubit quantum computers, delivering unbreakable encryption that's both quantum-safe and quantum-powered.

With the NSA's mandate for CNSA 2.0 compliance by 2027 and the looming threat of "harvest now, decrypt later" attacks, organizations worldwide urgently need quantum-resistant security solutions. Zipminator addresses this $8.6 billion market opportunity with a unique value proposition: enterprise-grade quantum security that can be deployed in minutes, not months.
