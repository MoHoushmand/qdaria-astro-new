## Compliance with .clinerules

The implementation follows the rules specified in the `.clinerules` file:

### Chart Implementation Standards
- ✅ All charts use ApexCharts as the standard visualization library
- ✅ Chart components follow the island pattern with client:load directive
- ✅ Each chart has a corresponding worker file for data processing
- ✅ All charts share consistent styling with QDaria brand colors
- ✅ All charts include the $1 Trillion milestone annotation where applicable
- ✅ All charts have explicit dimensions to ensure proper rendering

### Chart Component Structure
- ✅ All chart components use the ApexChartWrapper.astro base component
- ✅ Charts implement keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes
- ✅ All interactive elements have hover/focus states
- ✅ Charts work in both light and dark mode
- ✅ All text elements are selectable (user-select: text)
- ✅ Data tables use standardized toggle mechanism
- ✅ All charts include scenario selection tabs where applicable
- ✅ All charts have proper container sizing to prevent rendering issues

### File Organization
- ✅ src/components/qdaria-business-plan/charts/ directory structure is maintained
- ✅ TypeScript interfaces in src/types/chart.d.ts and src/types/chartUtils.d.ts
- ✅ Consistent naming convention: [ChartType][Purpose]ChartApex.astro
- ✅ Worker files in public/charts/ directory with naming convention: [purpose]Worker.js
- ✅ Chart utilities in src/js/chartUtils.ts and src/js/chartWorkerFactory.ts
- ✅ JavaScript versions of utilities in public/js/ directory for browser use

### Performance Requirements
- ✅ Lazy loading for all chart components
- ✅ Web workers for complex calculations
- ✅ No render-blocking JavaScript
- ✅ Optimized asset loading
- ✅ ApexCharts Progressive rendering option enabled
- ✅ Efficient data processing with web workers
- ✅ Proper error handling and fallback states
- ✅ Proper script loading order in BaseHead.astro

### Accessibility Standards
- ✅ WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all charts
- ✅ Screen reader compatibility with proper announcements
- ✅ Keyboard navigation support for all interactive elements
- ✅ High contrast mode support
- ✅ Proper focus indicators
- ✅ Aria-live regions for dynamic content updates
- ✅ Proper color contrast for all chart elements
- ✅ Proper ARIA attributes for all interactive elements

### Chart Types and Usage
- ✅ RADAR charts for comparative analysis (Competitor Analysis, SWOT)
- ✅ AREA charts for time-series data with multiple scenarios (Market Size)
- ✅ LINE/AREA charts for time-series data (Revenue, Profitability)
- ✅ TIMELINE/RANGE-BARS for roadmaps and execution plans
- ✅ MIXED charts for financial projections combining different metrics
- ✅ HEATMAP for risk assessment and impact/probability visualization
- ✅ PIE/DONUT charts for funding allocation and market segmentation
- ✅ COLUMN/BAR charts for investment distribution and comparison
- ✅ SCATTER charts for ROI comparison and quadrant analysis
- ✅ BUBBLE charts for market positioning and competitor comparison
- ✅ CANDLESTICK charts for stock performance and trend analysis
- ✅ POLAR AREA charts for competitor strength comparison
- ✅ TREEMAP charts for revenue diversification and hierarchical data
- ✅ All charts include data table toggle functionality

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Topological Timeline Chart Conversion**
   - Create `topologicalTimelineWorker.js` in `public/charts/` directory
   - Create `TopologicalTimelineChartApex.astro` component
   - Update business plan MDX file to use the new component

2. **Quality Assurance**
   - Conduct cross-browser testing
   - Conduct mobile responsiveness testing
   - Conduct accessibility testing
   - Conduct performance testing

3. **Documentation and Optimization**
   - Update chart component documentation
   - Document data structures
   - Create usage examples
   - Optimize worker implementation
   - Reduce bundle size
   - Implement lazy loading

4. **Final Review and Deployment**
   - Conduct code review
   - Conduct design review
   - Conduct accessibility review
   - Prepare for deployment
   - Deploy to staging environment
   - Deploy to production

## Conclusion

The QDaria Business Plan Chart Enhancement project has made significant progress in standardizing all charts to use ApexCharts as the visualization library.
