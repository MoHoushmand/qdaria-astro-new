# QDaria Business Plan - Section Numbering Correction Plan

## Overview

This document provides a detailed plan for correcting the section numbering inconsistencies in the QDaria Business Plan. The goal is to establish a consistent, hierarchical numbering system that properly reflects the document's structure and organization.

## Current Issues

The business plan currently contains several section numbering inconsistencies:

1. Missing parent sections
2. Incorrect sequential numbering
3. Duplicate section numbers
4. Inconsistent heading levels
5. Sections appearing out of sequence

## Correction Methodology

The corrections will follow these principles:

1. Maintain a strict hierarchical structure (1 → 1.1 → 1.1.1)
2. Ensure sequential numbering within each level
3. Preserve all existing content
4. Ensure each section has the appropriate parent section
5. Eliminate duplicate section numbers

## Implementation Steps

1. **Update MDX File**: Modify the business plan MDX file to reflect the corrected section numbering structure.

2. **Update Chart References**: Ensure all charts are properly associated with their corrected section numbers.

3. **Update Table of Contents**: Regenerate the table of contents to reflect the new section numbering.

4. **Review Heading Levels**: Ensure heading levels (h1, h2, h3, etc.) correctly correspond to the section numbering depth.

5. **Cross-Reference Check**: Verify that any cross-references within the document are updated to the new section numbers.

## Example MDX Changes

Here's an example of how to update the MDX file for a section with numbering issues:

### Before:
```mdx
## 2.10 2.2 SWOT Analysis

### 2.11 QDaria SWOT Analysis

#### 2.11.1 Strengths
...
```

### After:
```mdx
## 2.6 SWOT Analysis

### 2.6.1 QDaria SWOT Analysis

#### 2.6.2 Strengths
...
```

## Conclusion

Implementing these section numbering corrections will significantly improve the organization and readability of the QDaria Business Plan. The consistent numbering system will make it easier for readers to navigate the document and understand the hierarchical relationship between different sections.

The corrections preserve all existing content while establishing a logical structure that properly reflects the document's organization. Once implemented, these changes will ensure the business plan presents a professional and polished appearance.
