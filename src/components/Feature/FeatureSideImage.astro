    description:
      "We're researching Fibonacci anyons - exotic quasiparticles that emerge in two-dimensional systems. Through their non-Abelian braiding statistics, these anyons could create topologically protected qubits that are inherently immune to local perturbations. This theoretical advantage could potentially eliminate the need for complex error correction schemes, which is why we've chosen this approach for our long-term quantum computing research.",

    description:
      "Fibonacci anyons are theoretically powerful because they support universal quantum computation through braiding operations alone. This could eventually enable tackling the most challenging computational problems in quantum chemistry, materials science, and financial optimization. We're developing the foundational research needed to bring this technology from theory to practical implementation.",
