  {
    question: "What is topological quantum computing?",
    answer: "Topological quantum computing is a promising approach that uses special quantum states called anyons to create inherently stable qubits. Unlike traditional quantum computers that require complex error correction, topological qubits are protected by the fundamental laws of physics, making them naturally resistant to errors and decoherence. This is the approach QDaria is researching and developing."
  },
  {
    question: "What are Fibonacci anyons and why are they important?",
    answer: "Fibonacci anyons are exotic quantum particles that exist in two-dimensional systems. They are theoretically crucial for quantum computing because their braiding operations are naturally universal for quantum computation. This means they could perform any quantum calculation while maintaining topological protection, making them promising candidates for building reliable quantum computers."
  },
  {
    question: "What is QDaria's approach to quantum computing?",
    answer: "QDaria is researching Fibonacci anyon-based topological quantum computing. Our focus is on: 1) Developing theoretical frameworks for topologically protected qubits, 2) Exploring material systems that could host anyons, and 3) Building toward a scalable architecture. We're in the R&D phase, working to demonstrate these capabilities in future experimental implementations."
  },
  {
    question: "What industries could benefit from topological quantum computing?",
    answer: "Once developed, topological quantum computing could offer advantages across multiple industries: Financial services (portfolio optimization, risk analysis), Pharmaceuticals (drug discovery, molecular modeling), Cybersecurity (post-quantum cryptography), Logistics (supply chain optimization), and AI/ML (quantum machine learning, pattern recognition)."
  },
  {
    question: "How can organizations get involved with QDaria?",
    answer: "Organizations interested in quantum computing can partner with QDaria through research collaborations, join our early access program for future platforms, or engage with our consulting services to prepare for the quantum era. Contact us to discuss partnership opportunities and stay updated on our progress."
  },
  {
    question: "What makes topological quantum computing promising?",
    answer: "Traditional quantum computers rely on active error correction and require thousands of physical qubits to create a single logical qubit. Topological approaches using Fibonacci anyons could provide inherent stability at the hardware level, potentially requiring minimal error correction and enabling reliable scaling of logical qubits. This is why QDaria is focused on this approach for long-term quantum computing solutions."
